title={FPGAs: Fundamentals, Advanced Features, and Applications in Industrial Electronics},
publisher={CRC Press},
address={Bosa Roca},
edition={1},
abstract={Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are currently recognized as the most suitable platform for the implementation of complex digital systems targeting an increasing number of industrial electronics applications. They cover a huge variety of application areas, such as: aerospace, food industry, art, industrial automation, automotive, biomedicine, process control, military, logistics, power electronics, chemistry, sensor networks, robotics, ultrasound, security, and artificial vision. This book first presents the basic architectures of the devices to familiarize the reader with the fundamentals of FPGAs before identifying and discussing new resources that extend the ability of the devices to solve problems in new application domains. Design methodologies are discussed and application examples are included for some of these domains, e.g., mechatronics, robotics, and power systems.;This book explains the how and why of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) usage. It analyzes fundamental architectures of FPGA devices, providing case studies and simple design examples. It also describes advanced features of the latest devices, exploring new resources enabling problem solving in new application domains, such as high-speed sensor interfacing and control of power converters. From basic circuits to state-of-the-art implementations, this text demystifies FPGAs for engineers who are not digital designers but need efficient digital solutions for their systems to be competitive.;},

year={2012},
title={Reduction of Power Consumption in FPGAs - An Overview},
journal={International journal of information engineering and electronic business},
volume={4},
number={5},
pages={50-69},
abstract={Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs are highly desirable for implementation of digital systems due to their flexibility, programmability and low end product life cycle. In more than 20 years since the introduction of FPGA, research and development has produced dramatic improvements in FPGA speed and area efficiency, narrowing the gap between FPGAs and ASICs and making FPGAs the platform of choice for implementing digital circuits. FPGAs hold significant promise as a fast to market replacement. Unfortunately, the advantages of FPGAs are offset in many cases by their high power consumption and area. The goal is to reduce the power consumption without sacrificing much performance or incurring a large chip area so that the territories of FPGAs applications can expand more effectively. Reducing the power of FPGAs is the key to lowering packaging and cooling costs, improving device reliability, and opening the door to new markets such as mobile electronics. This paper presents the tips to lower down the static and dynamic power dissipation in FPGAs. It gives an overview of various techniques at system, device, and circuit and architecture level used for reduction of power consumption of FPGAs and their outcomes.},

author = {Vanderbauwhede, Wim and Benkrid, Khaled},
title = {High-Performance Computing Using FPGAs},
year = {2013},
isbn = {1461417902},
publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
abstract = {High-Performance Computing using FPGA covers the area of high performance reconfigurable computing (HPRC). This book provides an overview of architectures, tools and applications for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (HPRC). FPGAs offer very high I/O bandwidth and fine-grained, custom and flexible parallelism and with the ever-increasing computational needs coupled with the frequency/power wall, the increasing maturity and capabilities of FPGAs, and the advent of multicore processors which has caused the acceptance of parallel computational models. The Part on architectures will introduce different FPGA-based HPC platforms: attached co-processor HPRC architectures such as the CHRECs Novo-G and EPCCs Maxwell systems; tightly coupled HRPC architectures, e.g. the Convey hybrid-core computer; reconfigurably networked HPRC architectures, e.g. the QPACE system, and standalone HPRC architectures such as EPFLs CONFETTI system. The Part on Tools will focus on high-level programming approaches for HPRC, with chapters on C-to-Gate tools (such as Impulse-C, AutoESL, Handel-C, MORA-C++); Graphical tools (MATLAB-Simulink, NI LabVIEW); Domain-specific languages, languages for heterogeneous computing(for example OpenCL, Microsofts Kiwi and Alchemy projects). The part on Applications will present case from several application domains where HPRC has been used successfully, such as Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Financial Computing; Stencil computations; Information retrieval; Lattice QCD; Astrophysics simulations; Weather and climate modeling.}
